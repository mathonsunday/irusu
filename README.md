Irusu is a digital security education iOS app I built for [Ship Your Side Project](http://shipyoursideproject.com/) in 2017. 
This project taught me a huge amount about building a polished UI and gathering user feedback. I took stock of the work needed
to sufficiently polish the UI and bulk up the content before putting it in the App Store and decided that it wasn't worth it. 

While educating people about digital security is important, I'm not convinced that a mobile app is the right solution.
My goal was to build something more accessible than the long detailed guides you normally find on the web.
A good exmaple of this is the [Surveillance Self Defense](https://ssd.eff.org/en) guide from the Electronic Frontier Foundation.
However, a mobile app has limited benefit beyond digital security improvements you can make directly from your phone. 
A successfully mobile app would need to have an engaging user experience along with a deep catalogue of content. 
It would also need to be sufficiently compelling that someone without a strong need for heightened digital security would download it 
and use it regularly. Overall, I think mainstream digital security education is a difficult problem to solve. 

This app was inspired by Primer, Mimo, Startup Patterns, Encode, Enki and Py.
